\apidescription{
  \FUNC{shmem\_team\_destroy\_ctx} collectively destroys a context that was
  created by a call to \FUNC{shmem\_team\_create\_ctx}.
  It is the user's responsibility to ensure that the context is not used
  after it has been destroyed.

  As \FUNC{shmem\_team\_create\_ctx} is collective, it includes calls to
  procedures semantically equivalent to \FUNC{shmem\_team\_barrier} on entry
  and \FUNC{shmem\_team\_sync} on exit.

  It is invalid to pass \CONST{SHMEM\_CTX\_DEFAULT} or a context handle
  returned by a call to \FUNC{shmem\_ctx\_create} to this routine.
