\begin{apiarguments}
  \apiargument{IN}{team}{A handle to the specified \ac{PE} team.}
  \apiargument{IN}{options}{
    The set of options requested for the given context.
    Multiple options may be requested by combining them with a bitwise OR
    operation; otherwise, \CONST{0} can be given if no options are requested.}
  \apiargument{OUT}{ctx}{A handle to the newly created context.}
\end{apiarguments}

\apidescription{
  The \FUNC{shmem\_team\_create\_ctx} routine creates a new communication
  context and returns its handle through the \VAR{ctx} argument.
  This context is created from the team specified by the \VAR{team} argument.

  The \FUNC{shmem\_team\_create\_ctx} routine must be called by no more threads
  than were specified by the \VAR{num\_threads} member of the
  \CTYPE{shmem\_team\_config\_t} configuration parameters that were specified
  when the team was created.

  %% All \openshmem routines that operate on this context will do so with
  %% respect to the associated \ac{PE} team.
  %% That is, all point-to-point routines operating on this context will use
  %% team-relative \ac{PE} numbering.

  In addition to the team, the \FUNC{shmem\_team\_create\_ctx} routine accepts
  the same arguments and provides all the same return conditions as the
  \FUNC{shmem\_ctx\_create} routine.
}

\apireturnvalues{
  Zero on success and nonzero otherwise.

\apinotes{
  None.
