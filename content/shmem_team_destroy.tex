\apidescription{
The \FUNC{shmem\_team\_destroy} function destroys an existing team. This is a
collective call, in which every member of the team being destroyed needs
to participate. This will free all internal memory structures associated
with the team and invalidate the team handle. Upon return, the team
handle can no longer be used for team API calls.

It is considered erroneous to free \LibHandleRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_WORLD} or
any other predefined team. Error checking will be done to ensure a valid
team handle is provided. Errors will result in a return value less than \CONST{0}.

\apireturnvalues{

\CONST{0} will be returned.
