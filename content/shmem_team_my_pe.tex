\apidescription{
The \FUNC{shmem\_team\_my\_pe} function returns the number of calling \ac{PE} within the
provided team. The number will be a value between 0 and N-1,
for a team of size N. Each member of the team has a unique number.
For the team \CONST{SHMEM\_TEAM\_WORLD}, this will return the same value
as \FUNC{shmem\_my\_pe}.

Error checking will be done to ensure a valid team handle is provided.
All errors are considered fatal, and will result in the job aborting
with an informative error message.
}

\apireturnvalues{
The number of the calling \ac{PE} within the provided team.
}

\apinotes{
By default, \openshmem creates two predefined teams that will be available
for use once the routine \FUNC{shmem\_init} has been called. These teams can be
referenced in the application by the handles \CONST{SHMEM\_TEAM\_WORLD} and
\CONST{SHMEM\_TEAM\_NODE}. Every PE process is a member of the \CONST{SHMEM\_TEAM\_WORLD}
team, and its number in \CONST{SHMEM\_TEAM\_WORLD} corresponds to the value of its
global \ac{PE} number. The \CONST{SHMEM\_TEAM\_NODE} team contains only the set of \acp{PE}
that reside on the same node as the current \ac{PE}.
